# TensorFlow Introduction
### Tensorflow tutorial
Explore a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks more easily.

Build deep neural networks easily using TensorFlow, instead of NumPy.
Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, Torch, Caffe, Keras, etc. can speed up our machine learning development significantly.

You will implement TensorFlow 2.3 here!
