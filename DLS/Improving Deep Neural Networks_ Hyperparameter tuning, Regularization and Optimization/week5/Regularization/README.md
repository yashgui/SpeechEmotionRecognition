# Regularization
## Learn different regularization techniques

**Overfitting** can be a serious problem in neural networks, if the training dataset is not big enough. In that case, though it does well on the training set, but the learned network doesn't generalize to new examples that it has never seen!
So, we use **Regularization** which ruduces the variance (& hence overfitting).
