# Speech Emotion Recognition Project
I have taken the Machine Learning Specialization and Deep Learning Specialization courses from coursera and added the labs that I did in the repo here
1. Machine Learning Specialization
  1. [Supervised Machine Learning - Regression and Classification](https://github.com/yashgui/SpeechEmotionRecognition/tree/main/MLS/C1%20-%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Regression%20and%20Classification)
  2. [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/yashgui/SpeechEmotionRecognition/tree/main/MLS/C2%20-%20Advanced%20Learning%20Algorithms)
  3. [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/yashgui/SpeechEmotionRecognition/tree/main/MLS/C3%20-%20Unsupervised%20Learning%2C%20Recommenders%2C%20Reinforcement%20Learning)
2. Deep Learning Specialization
  1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/yashgui/SpeechEmotionRecognition/tree/main/DLS/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)
  2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://github.com/yashgui/SpeechEmotionRecognition/tree/main/DLS/Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks_%20Hyperparameter%20tuning%2C%20Regularization%20and%20Optimization)
  3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/yashgui/SpeechEmotionRecognition/tree/main/DLS/Structuring%20Machine%20Learning%20Projects)
